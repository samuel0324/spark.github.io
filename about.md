### More Information

The summer before my junior year in college, I shadowed a plastic surgeon at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital as a premed student. I had dedicated days and nights for years studying with the aim of becoming a physician one day in mind. However, as I got to witness what being a doctor entailed in real life, I learned that medicine was not for me. The technical and intellectual rigor intrigued me, but I could not see myself fulfilling my life as a doctor. 

Luckily, when the mental fog surrounding medical school lifted, I quickly saw what I had always wanted. Seeing and hearing the stories, albeit very sparse, of my grandfather's military career had always stirred my heart with desire to serve. 

In my final semester in college, I took a course called Social Media, Technology, and Conflicts. The class discussions were based on a book called LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media as well as RAND reports. Every reading assignment and discussion session fueled my desire to join the fight against all forms of malicious information efforts. The RAND reports emphasized the critical need for development of data-driven tools, such as smart and fast bot detection methods and ethical and effective countermeasures for the spread of misinformation. 

As the United States and the global community are growing ever more polarized largely due to increasingly aggressive warfare in the information domain , I strongly believe that data-driven measures must be developed and implemented to mitigate further corrosion of our social cohesion. issues such as truth-decay driven by malicious foreign and domestic as well as state and non-state actors are at the core of my call for service as well as my desire to put the data science skills I have acquired to good use.
